Fun fact...
This dialogue was made before my sprite.
Atleast that's what I was told at assignment.
I don't even know what a sprite is.
But I think you might be one kid...
I'm on to you.

Hello!
Can you please go away.
I'm kind of busy doing nothing.

yeah that's right.
I don't think I can make room for you in my schedule.
